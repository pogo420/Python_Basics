## Open Close Principle(OCP)
* Open for extension not modification.

## Liskov's substitution principle(LSP)
* A subclass must be 100% replaced by super class.

## Interface segmentation principle(ISP)
* Make the interface as precise as possible.
* Don't keep redundant methods.
* Keep multiple interfaces with inheritance.

# Dependency inversion principle(DIP)
* High level class should not depend on low level class. There must be an abstraction in between.
* Details must be dependent on abstraction. Not vice versa.
